        <img id="spacing" src="../images/spacing.PNG">

        <p class="comments">Notice the spacing between the pictures and the rest of the page. Its uneven and awkward. All of the white space causes readers to look all over the page trying to find the flow of the page. The lack of proper spacing prevents the ease of reading and might cause the reader to miss information they are looking for. </p>

        <img id="navbar" src="../images/navbar.PNG">

        <p class="comments">The navigation bar is small black basic font aligned to the far left page. ther is no css format to indicate that they are links to other parts of the page. Also since it's far to the left side of the page there is a chance that a reader may not see this outright.</p>


        <p class="comments">Suzanne Collins is a award winning, all-time best selling author. She is known for her best selling books: <i>The Hunger Games.</i> However her offical website comes off as unprofessional especially so for someone of her reputation.</p>
